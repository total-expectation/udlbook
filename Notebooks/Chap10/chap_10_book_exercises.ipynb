    "\n",
    "Then we can show that convolving over the input x and then shifting is the same as shifting x and then convolving over the result. Therefore, the following must hold for equivariance to be satisfied $$f(t(x)) = t(f(x))$$, where f is the convolution and t is the shifting operator. To show this we have the following proof, where we perform a clever reindexing or transformation so to speak $k = k' - c$\n",
